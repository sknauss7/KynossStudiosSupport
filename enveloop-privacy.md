# Privacy Policy for Enveloop

**Last Updated: February 13, 2026**

## Introduction

Enveloop ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data collection and usage.

## Data Collection

**We collect ZERO data.**

Enveloop stores all your financial information locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. We have no servers, no backend, no analytics, no tracking, and absolutely no access to your data.

## Information Stored on Your Device

The following information is stored locally on your device only:

- Your paycheck amount and frequency
- Your account balance
- Bills you create (name, amount, due date, recurrence, notes, icon)
- Envelope allocation amounts
- App settings and preferences (such as appearance/dark mode)

**This data never leaves your device.**

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not share any data because we do not have access to any data. 

Enveloop does not use:
- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Crash reporting services
- Social media integrations
- Cloud backup services (unless you enable iCloud on your device)
- Any third-party SDKs or libraries that collect data

## iCloud

If you have iCloud enabled on your device, iOS may automatically back up the app's data as part of your device backup. This is controlled by your device settings, not by Enveloop. We do not directly access or control iCloud backups.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device and protected by iOS's security measures:
- Your data is protected by your device passcode/biometrics
- Data is automatically encrypted by iOS when your device is locked
- We cannot access, recover, or reset your data

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **View**: All your data is visible within the app
- **Edit**: You can modify any information at any time
- **Delete Individual Items**: Delete bills or reset allocations as needed
- **Delete All Data**: Use "Reset All Data" in Settings to erase everything
- **Uninstall**: Deleting the app removes all data from your device

## Children's Privacy

Enveloop does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13, because we don't collect any information at all.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how the app handles data, we will:
- Update this privacy policy
- Update the "Last Updated" date
- Notify users through an app update description

We will never retroactively change our core privacy principle: your data stays on your device.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have certain rights. However, since Enveloop does not collect any personal information, these provisions do not apply.

## European Privacy Rights (GDPR)

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), EU residents have certain rights. However, since Enveloop does not process any personal data, these provisions do not apply.

## Summary

**Your financial data is private. Period.**

Enveloop was built from the ground up with privacy as the foundation. We believe your financial information belongs to you and you alone.
