            <!-- 1. OVERVIEW -->
            <h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
            <p>Brevvi ("the App") is developed and published by Kynoss Studios ("we," "us," or "our"). Brevvi is a meeting notes app for iPhone (iOS 26 and later) that records meetings, transcribes speech, and generates AI-powered summaries with action items, decisions, and follow-ups — all processed entirely on your device.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data Brevvi accesses, how that data is processed, and your rights regarding your information. We are committed to transparency and to protecting your privacy.</p>
            <p><strong>Brevvi operates entirely on your device.</strong> We do not operate servers, databases, or cloud services. We do not create user accounts. We have no mechanism to collect, receive, view, or store your personal data. The data Brevvi works with exists solely on your iPhone, under your control.</p>

            <!-- 2. MICROPHONE & AUDIO RECORDING -->
            <h2 id="microphone">2. Microphone &amp; Audio Recording</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Brevvi records audio only when you explicitly start a meeting recording.</strong> Audio is saved locally on your device and is never uploaded, transmitted, or made accessible to anyone other than you.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>When you tap the record button, Brevvi uses Apple's audio framework to capture audio from your device's microphone. The audio is:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Saved as an AAC audio file stored locally on your device.</li>
                <li>Simultaneously streamed to Apple's on-device SpeechAnalyzer framework for real-time transcription (see Section 3).</li>
                <li>Never transmitted over any network connection.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Recording only occurs when you actively start it. Brevvi does not record audio in the background without your knowledge, does not listen passively, and does not activate the microphone for any purpose other than meeting recording that you initiate.</p>

            <h3>What We Store</h3>
            <p>Audio recordings are stored as AAC files in Brevvi's local data store on your device. These files are protected by iOS app sandboxing and data protection encryption. Only Brevvi can access these files.</p>

            <h3>Your Control</h3>
            <p>Microphone access requires your explicit permission via the iOS permission prompt. You can revoke microphone access at any time in Settings &gt; Brevvi. You can delete individual meeting recordings from within the app at any time.</p>

            <!-- 3. ON-DEVICE TRANSCRIPTION -->
            <h2 id="transcription">3. On-Device Transcription</h2>
            <p>Brevvi uses Apple's SpeechAnalyzer framework (iOS 26) to transcribe meeting audio into text. This transcription happens entirely on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The speech recognition model runs as a system service on your iPhone's Neural Engine.</li>
                <li><strong>No audio data is sent to Apple's servers or any third-party service for transcription.</strong></li>
                <li>Transcription occurs in real time during recording, providing live text as people speak.</li>
                <li>The resulting transcript is stored locally alongside the meeting recording.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Apple's SpeechAnalyzer is a fully on-device framework. Unlike cloud-based transcription services, the audio signal never leaves the device's processing pipeline.</p>

            <!-- 4. ON-DEVICE AI SUMMARIZATION -->
            <h2 id="ai">4. On-Device AI Summarization</h2>
            <p>Brevvi uses Apple's Foundation Models framework to generate meeting summaries, action items, decisions, and follow-ups from your transcripts. This AI processing happens entirely on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The AI model runs locally on your iPhone's Neural Engine.</li>
                <li><strong>No transcript or meeting data is sent to Apple's servers, OpenAI, or any third-party AI service.</strong></li>
                <li>All AI-generated content (summaries, action items, decisions, follow-ups) is stored locally on your device.</li>
                <li>Kynoss Studios has no access to your meeting content, AI inputs, or AI outputs.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 5. DATA STORAGE & ON-DEVICE PROCESSING -->
            <h2 id="data-storage">5. Data Storage &amp; On-Device Processing</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>All data processing occurs entirely on your iPhone.</strong> Brevvi has no servers, no cloud infrastructure, no databases, and no backend of any kind. We literally cannot access your data because we have no system to receive it.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Audio recordings (AAC files)</li>
                <li>Transcripts (text)</li>
                <li>AI-generated summaries, action items, decisions, and follow-ups</li>
                <li>Meeting metadata (date, duration, title)</li>
                <li>App preferences and settings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This data is protected by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>iOS Data Protection (encrypted at rest, tied to your device passcode)</li>
                <li>App sandboxing (only Brevvi can access its own data store)</li>
                <li>Standard iOS security architecture</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Brevvi does not use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>iCloud or any cloud storage</li>
                <li>Any third-party SDKs, frameworks, or libraries</li>
                <li>Analytics services (no Firebase, no Mixpanel, no Amplitude, etc.)</li>
                <li>Advertising SDKs or ad networks</li>
                <li>Crash reporting services</li>
                <li>Any form of user tracking or fingerprinting</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 6. DATA RETENTION & DELETION -->
            <h2 id="data-retention">6. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>

            <h3>Retention Policy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free tier:</strong> Meeting recordings, transcripts, and summaries are retained on your device for 7 days. After 7 days, meetings are automatically removed from the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Brevvi Pro:</strong> All meeting data is retained indefinitely on your device until you choose to delete it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Deletion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delete individual meetings:</strong> You can delete any meeting recording, transcript, and associated data from within the app at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete the app:</strong> Deleting Brevvi from your device permanently removes all associated data. Because no data exists anywhere other than your device, deletion is complete and irreversible.</li>
                <li>There is no server-side data to delete, no account to close, and no request process needed. You have full and immediate control.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 7. DATA SHARING & THIRD PARTIES -->
            <h2 id="data-sharing">7. Data Sharing &amp; Third Parties</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Brevvi does not share your data with anyone.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>We do not sell your data.</li>
                <li>We do not share your data with third parties.</li>
                <li>We do not transmit your data off your device.</li>
                <li>We do not use third-party SDKs that could collect data.</li>
                <li>We do not serve advertisements.</li>
                <li>We do not engage in data mining or use-based data profiling.</li>
                <li>We do not share data with parent companies, subsidiaries, or related entities (Kynoss Studios is an independent sole developer).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Brevvi makes no network requests whatsoever. The app functions entirely offline.</p>

            <!-- 8. DATA SECURITY -->
            <h2 id="data-security">8. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Brevvi relies on Apple's built-in security infrastructure to protect your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> All local data is protected by iOS Data Protection, which encrypts data using keys tied to your device passcode.</li>
                <li><strong>App sandboxing:</strong> iOS prevents other apps from accessing Brevvi's data store.</li>
                <li><strong>No network exposure:</strong> Because Brevvi does not transmit any data over any network, there is no risk of data interception, server breaches, or unauthorized remote access.</li>
                <li><strong>No accounts:</strong> There are no credentials to steal, no passwords to breach, and no accounts to compromise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Meeting recordings may contain sensitive or confidential information. Brevvi's on-device architecture ensures this content is protected by the same security measures that protect all data on your iPhone, including Face ID/Touch ID, device passcode encryption, and hardware-backed key storage.</p>

            <!-- 9. IN-APP PURCHASES -->
            <h2 id="purchases">9. In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>Brevvi offers a one-time in-app purchase ("Brevvi Pro") to unlock additional features. This purchase is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store using StoreKit. Kynoss Studios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does not collect payment information (Apple handles all transactions).</li>
                <li>Does not store credit card numbers, billing addresses, or financial data.</li>
                <li>Receives only an anonymous transaction confirmation from Apple's StoreKit framework.</li>
                <li>Cannot identify you from purchase information.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 10. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY (COPPA) -->
            <h2 id="children">10. Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h2>
            <p>Brevvi is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
            <p>Because Brevvi does not collect, transmit, or store personal information on any server, and because all data remains solely on the user's device, Brevvi does not create the data collection risks that COPPA is designed to address. Nonetheless:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brevvi does not collect personal information from any user, including children.</li>
                <li>Brevvi does not require or support account creation.</li>
                <li>Brevvi contains no advertising, in-app purchases directed at children, or social features.</li>
                <li>Brevvi does not transmit any data to Kynoss Studios or any third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's use of the app, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kynossstudios@gmail.com">kynossstudios@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal data. We respect these rights, even though Brevvi's on-device architecture means we do not act as a data controller or processor of your personal data in the traditional sense — because your data never reaches us.</p>

            <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
            <p>To the extent any on-device processing constitutes "processing" under the GDPR, the legal basis is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You explicitly grant permission for microphone access through the iOS permission prompt. You may withdraw consent at any time via iOS Settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> Processing your data on your own device to provide the app's functionality directly to you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> All data is stored on your device and accessible to you at all times within the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You can manage and modify your data within the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to erasure:</strong> You can delete individual meetings or all data by deleting the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> You can revoke microphone permission at any time without affecting access to existing meetings.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> Brevvi Pro includes export functionality (Markdown, PDF) to move your data to other tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You can stop all data processing by revoking permissions or deleting the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>Brevvi does not transfer personal data outside your device. No cross-border data transfers occur because no data is transmitted to any server, anywhere.</p>

            <h3>Data Protection Officer</h3>
            <p>Due to the nature of our data processing (entirely on-device, no data collection), we are not required to appoint a Data Protection Officer. For any privacy-related inquiries, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kynossstudios@gmail.com">kynossstudios@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <!-- 12. CCPA/CPRA -->
            <h2 id="ccpa">12. Your Rights Under CCPA/CPRA (California)</h2>
            <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) provides you with specific rights.</p>

            <h3>Information We Process</h3>
            <p>Under CCPA/CPRA definitions, Brevvi processes the following categories of information <strong>on your device only</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Audio data (meeting recordings captured with your consent)</li>
                <li>Text data (transcripts and AI-generated summaries)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, because all processing occurs on your device and we never collect, receive, or access this information, Kynoss Studios does not "collect" personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA.</p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to know:</strong> This Privacy Policy describes all data the app processes. We do not collect additional data beyond what is described here.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to delete:</strong> Delete individual meetings in the app or delete the app to remove all data.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to opt out of sale:</strong> <strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong> We never have and never will.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to opt out of sharing:</strong> We do not share your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising or any other purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to non-discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to limit use of sensitive personal information:</strong> Audio recordings may be considered sensitive under CPRA. You control recording through the explicit record action and can delete recordings at any time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"</h3>
            <p>Brevvi does not sell or share personal information. Because no data is transmitted from your device to us or any third party, there is no sale or sharing to opt out of. We fully comply with the CCPA/CPRA without requiring any user action.</p>

            <!-- 13. APPLE PLATFORM DISCLOSURES -->
            <h2 id="apple-requirements">13. Apple Platform Disclosures</h2>
            <p>In compliance with Apple's App Store Review Guidelines and platform requirements:</p>

            <h3>Microphone Usage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Brevvi uses the microphone solely to record meetings at the user's explicit request.</li>
                <li>Microphone access is requested only when needed and explained through a pre-permission screen before the system prompt.</li>
                <li>Audio data is processed and stored only on the user's device.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Background Audio</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Brevvi uses the <code>audio</code> background mode to continue recording meetings when the app is backgrounded. This ensures recordings are not interrupted if the user switches apps during a meeting.</li>
                <li>Background recording only occurs during an active meeting that the user has explicitly started. Brevvi does not record in the background at any other time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Required Reason APIs</h3>
            <p>Brevvi uses only Apple's first-party frameworks and does not access any APIs that require declared reasons beyond those already disclosed in this policy and in the app's App Store privacy nutrition label.</p>

            <h3>App Tracking Transparency</h3>
            <p>Brevvi does not track users across apps or websites owned by other companies. The App Tracking Transparency framework is not used because no tracking occurs.</p>

            <h3>App Privacy Nutrition Label</h3>
            <p>Brevvi's App Store privacy nutrition label accurately reflects that the app does not collect data linked to user identity and does not track users.</p>
