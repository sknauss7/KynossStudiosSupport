            <!-- 1. OVERVIEW -->
            <h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
            <p>Reapyr ("the App") is developed and published by Kynoss Studios ("we," "us," or "our"). Reapyr is a PDF data extraction app for Mac (macOS 26 and later) that detects tables and document structure in PDFs, maps extracted values to user-defined templates, and exports data as CSV or clipboard content — all processed entirely on your device.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data Reapyr accesses, how that data is processed, and your rights regarding your information. We are committed to transparency and to protecting your privacy.</p>
            <p><strong>Reapyr operates entirely on your Mac.</strong> We do not operate servers, databases, or cloud services. We do not create user accounts. We have no mechanism to collect, receive, view, or store your personal data. The data Reapyr works with exists solely on your Mac, under your control.</p>

            <!-- 2. FILE ACCESS & PDF PROCESSING -->
            <h2 id="file-access">2. File Access &amp; PDF Processing</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Reapyr only accesses files you explicitly provide</strong> through drag-and-drop or the file picker. PDF content is processed locally and is never uploaded, transmitted, or made accessible to anyone other than you.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>When you drop a PDF into Reapyr or select one via the file picker, Reapyr uses Apple's PDFKit framework to load and render the document. The PDF is:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Loaded into memory for rendering and text extraction.</li>
                <li>Rendered page-by-page for on-device document recognition (see Section 3).</li>
                <li>Never copied to Reapyr's data store — only extracted results are saved.</li>
                <li>Never transmitted over any network connection.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>File Permissions</h3>
            <p>Reapyr uses macOS sandboxed file access with read-only permission for user-selected files. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reapyr can only read files you explicitly provide — it cannot browse your file system.</li>
                <li>Reapyr cannot modify your original PDF files.</li>
                <li>File access is governed by macOS App Sandbox, the same security model used by all Mac App Store apps.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 3. ON-DEVICE DOCUMENT RECOGNITION -->
            <h2 id="vision">3. On-Device Document Recognition</h2>
            <p>Reapyr uses Apple's Vision framework (RecognizeDocumentsRequest) to detect tables, paragraphs, lists, and other document structures in your PDFs. This recognition happens entirely on your Mac:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The document recognition model runs as a system service on your Mac's Neural Engine and CPU.</li>
                <li><strong>No PDF content, page images, or extracted text is sent to Apple's servers or any third-party service.</strong></li>
                <li>Recognition occurs page-by-page, extracting structured data (table cells, paragraph text, list items).</li>
                <li>The extracted structure is stored locally as part of your extraction results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Apple's Vision framework processes data entirely on-device. The page images and extracted text never leave your Mac's processing pipeline.</p>

            <!-- 4. ON-DEVICE AI FIELD MAPPING -->
            <h2 id="ai">4. On-Device AI Field Mapping</h2>
            <p>Reapyr uses Apple's Foundation Models framework to intelligently map extracted table data to your template fields. This AI processing happens entirely on your Mac:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The AI model runs locally on your Mac's Neural Engine.</li>
                <li><strong>No extracted text, table data, or template information is sent to Apple's servers, OpenAI, or any third-party AI service.</strong></li>
                <li>All AI-generated field mappings are stored locally on your Mac.</li>
                <li>Kynoss Studios has no access to your document content, AI inputs, or AI outputs.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 5. DATA STORAGE & ON-DEVICE PROCESSING -->
            <h2 id="data-storage">5. Data Storage &amp; On-Device Processing</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>All data processing occurs entirely on your Mac.</strong> Reapyr has no servers, no cloud infrastructure, no databases, and no backend of any kind. We literally cannot access your data because we have no system to receive it.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Data is stored locally on your Mac using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extraction templates (field names, field types)</li>
                <li>Extraction results (field values, page references)</li>
                <li>App preferences and settings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Reapyr does <strong>not</strong> store your original PDF files. Only the extracted data (text values, table contents) is saved.</p>

            <p>This data is protected by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>macOS Data Protection (encrypted at rest, tied to your Mac's security)</li>
                <li>App sandboxing (only Reapyr can access its own data store)</li>
                <li>Standard macOS security architecture</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Reapyr does not use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>iCloud or any cloud storage</li>
                <li>Any third-party SDKs, frameworks, or libraries</li>
                <li>Analytics services (no Firebase, no Mixpanel, no Amplitude, etc.)</li>
                <li>Advertising SDKs or ad networks</li>
                <li>Crash reporting services</li>
                <li>Any form of user tracking or fingerprinting</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 6. DATA RETENTION & DELETION -->
            <h2 id="data-retention">6. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>

            <h3>Retention Policy</h3>
            <p>All extraction templates, results, and app data are retained locally on your Mac until you choose to delete them. There is no automatic expiration.</p>

            <h3>Deletion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delete individual items:</strong> You can delete individual templates or extraction results from within the app at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete the app:</strong> Deleting Reapyr from your Mac permanently removes all associated data. Because no data exists anywhere other than your Mac, deletion is complete and irreversible.</li>
                <li>There is no server-side data to delete, no account to close, and no request process needed. You have full and immediate control.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 7. DATA SHARING & THIRD PARTIES -->
            <h2 id="data-sharing">7. Data Sharing &amp; Third Parties</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Reapyr does not share your data with anyone.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>We do not sell your data.</li>
                <li>We do not share your data with third parties.</li>
                <li>We do not transmit your data off your device.</li>
                <li>We do not use third-party SDKs that could collect data.</li>
                <li>We do not serve advertisements.</li>
                <li>We do not engage in data mining or use-based data profiling.</li>
                <li>We do not share data with parent companies, subsidiaries, or related entities (Kynoss Studios is an independent sole developer).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Reapyr makes no network requests whatsoever, except for StoreKit transactions processed by Apple (see Section 9). The app functions entirely offline.</p>

            <!-- 8. DATA SECURITY -->
            <h2 id="data-security">8. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Reapyr relies on Apple's built-in security infrastructure to protect your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> All local data is protected by macOS Data Protection and FileVault encryption.</li>
                <li><strong>App sandboxing:</strong> macOS prevents other apps from accessing Reapyr's data store.</li>
                <li><strong>No network exposure:</strong> Because Reapyr does not transmit any data over any network, there is no risk of data interception, server breaches, or unauthorized remote access.</li>
                <li><strong>No accounts:</strong> There are no credentials to steal, no passwords to breach, and no accounts to compromise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PDFs processed by Reapyr may contain sensitive or confidential business information — financial reports, invoices, bank statements, lab results. Reapyr's on-device architecture ensures this content is protected by the same security measures that protect all data on your Mac.</p>

            <!-- 9. IN-APP PURCHASES -->
            <h2 id="purchases">9. In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>Reapyr offers a one-time in-app purchase ("Reapyr Pro") to unlock additional features. This purchase is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store using StoreKit. Kynoss Studios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does not collect payment information (Apple handles all transactions).</li>
                <li>Does not store credit card numbers, billing addresses, or financial data.</li>
                <li>Receives only an anonymous transaction confirmation from Apple's StoreKit framework.</li>
                <li>Cannot identify you from purchase information.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 10. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY (COPPA) -->
            <h2 id="children">10. Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h2>
            <p>Reapyr is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
            <p>Because Reapyr does not collect, transmit, or store personal information on any server, and because all data remains solely on the user's device, Reapyr does not create the data collection risks that COPPA is designed to address. Nonetheless:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reapyr does not collect personal information from any user, including children.</li>
                <li>Reapyr does not require or support account creation.</li>
                <li>Reapyr contains no advertising, in-app purchases directed at children, or social features.</li>
                <li>Reapyr does not transmit any data to Kynoss Studios or any third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's use of the app, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kynossstudios@gmail.com">kynossstudios@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <!-- 11. GDPR -->
            <h2 id="gdpr">11. Your Rights Under GDPR (European Economic Area)</h2>
            <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal data. We respect these rights, even though Reapyr's on-device architecture means we do not act as a data controller or processor of your personal data in the traditional sense — because your data never reaches us.</p>

            <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
            <p>To the extent any on-device processing constitutes "processing" under the GDPR, the legal basis is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You explicitly provide files through drag-and-drop or the file picker. You may stop providing files at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> Processing your data on your own device to provide the app's functionality directly to you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>

            <h3>Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>Reapyr does not transfer personal data outside your device. No cross-border data transfers occur because no data is transmitted to any server, anywhere.</p>

            <h3>Data Protection Officer</h3>
            <p>Due to the nature of our data processing (entirely on-device, no data collection), we are not required to appoint a Data Protection Officer. For any privacy-related inquiries, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kynossstudios@gmail.com">kynossstudios@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <!-- 12. CCPA/CPRA -->
            <h2 id="ccpa">12. Your Rights Under CCPA/CPRA (California)</h2>
            <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) provides you with specific rights.</p>

            <h3>Information We Process</h3>
            <p>Under CCPA/CPRA definitions, Reapyr processes the following categories of information <strong>on your device only</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Document data (PDF content you provide for extraction)</li>
                <li>Text data (extracted values, table contents, template definitions)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, because all processing occurs on your device and we never collect, receive, or access this information, Kynoss Studios does not "collect" personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA.</p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to know:</strong> This Privacy Policy describes all data the app processes. We do not collect additional data beyond what is described here.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to delete:</strong> Delete individual items in the app or delete the app to remove all data.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to opt out of sale:</strong> <strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong> We never have and never will.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to opt out of sharing:</strong> We do not share your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising or any other purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to non-discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to limit use of sensitive personal information:</strong> PDF documents may contain sensitive information. You control processing through the explicit file selection action and can delete extracted data at any time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"</h3>
            <p>Reapyr does not sell or share personal information. Because no data is transmitted from your device to us or any third party, there is no sale or sharing to opt out of. We fully comply with the CCPA/CPRA without requiring any user action.</p>

            <!-- 13. APPLE PLATFORM DISCLOSURES -->
            <h2 id="apple-requirements">13. Apple Platform Disclosures</h2>
            <p>In compliance with Apple's App Store Review Guidelines and platform requirements:</p>

            <h3>File Access</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reapyr accesses files solely through user-initiated actions (drag-and-drop or file picker).</li>
                <li>File access is sandboxed with read-only permission for user-selected files.</li>
                <li>Reapyr does not access files beyond what the user explicitly provides.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>On-Device AI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reapyr uses Apple's Vision framework for document structure recognition and Apple's Foundation Models framework for intelligent field mapping.</li>
                <li>Both frameworks process data entirely on-device. No document content is sent to any server.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Required Reason APIs</h3>
            <p>Reapyr uses only Apple's first-party frameworks and does not access any APIs that require declared reasons beyond those already disclosed in this policy and in the app's App Store privacy nutrition label.</p>

            <h3>App Tracking Transparency</h3>
            <p>Reapyr does not track users across apps or websites owned by other companies. The App Tracking Transparency framework is not used because no tracking occurs.</p>

            <h3>App Privacy Nutrition Label</h3>
            <p>Reapyr's App Store privacy nutrition label accurately reflects that the app does not collect data linked to user identity and does not track users.</p>
