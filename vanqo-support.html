        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Vanqo turns your debt payoff journey into a game. Here's how to begin:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Meet Your First Enemy:</strong> Add a debt by entering its name, balance, interest rate, and minimum payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose Your Weapon:</strong> Enter your paycheck amount and how often you're paid.</li>
            <li><strong>See Your Battle Plan:</strong> Vanqo calculates the optimal payoff strategy using the avalanche method (highest interest first).</li>
            <li><strong>Attack:</strong> Log each payment and watch the damage numbers fly. Every dollar is XP.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>What is the avalanche method?</h3>
            <p>The avalanche method pays minimum payments on all debts, then throws every extra dollar at the debt with the highest interest rate. This saves the most money in interest over time. Vanqo automates the math so you never have to think about it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>What's included in the free version?</h3>
            <p>The free version lets you track 1 debt with full functionality: health bar, payment logging, basic celebrations, and your battle plan. Upgrading to the full version ($4.99 one-time) unlocks unlimited debts, the war map, full gamification, all celebration tiers, the "What If" simulator, streak tracking, and XP/leveling.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>
            <p>All your data is stored locally on your device. We never collect, transmit, or have access to your financial information. No accounts, no servers, no analytics. Your data never leaves your phone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Do I need to connect my bank account?</h3>
            <p>No. Vanqo never connects to your bank, credit cards, or any financial institution. You manually enter debts and log payments. This is intentional: the act of logging a payment is the core game mechanic, and your financial data stays completely private.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I restore my purchase on a new device?</h3>
            <p>Go to Settings and tap "Restore Purchases." Your one-time purchase is linked to your Apple ID and can be restored on any device signed into the same account.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Can I edit a debt after adding it?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Tap any debt to view its details, then tap Edit to update the name, balance, interest rate, or minimum payment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>What happens when I pay off a debt?</h3>
            <p>When a debt's balance reaches zero, you'll see a boss death celebration sequence. The debt is marked as defeated, and its freed monthly payment is shown as increased attack power for your remaining debts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How does the streak system work?</h3>
            <p>Your streak counts consecutive pay periods where you hit your payment plan. If you miss one, your streak pauses with no penalty. Just pick back up when you're ready.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I delete all my data?</h3>
            <p>Go to Settings and tap "Reset All Data." This permanently erases all debts, payments, and progress.</p>
