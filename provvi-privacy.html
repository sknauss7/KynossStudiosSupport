            <!-- 1. OVERVIEW -->
            <h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
            <p>Provvi ("the App") is developed and published by Kynoss Studios ("we," "us," or "our"). Provvi is a kitchen inventory app for iPhone (iOS 26 and later) that helps you track what's in your kitchen, monitor expiration dates, and get AI-powered meal suggestions to reduce food waste.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data Provvi accesses, how that data is processed, and your rights regarding your information. We are committed to transparency and to protecting your privacy.</p>
            <p><strong>Provvi operates primarily on your device.</strong> We do not operate servers, databases, or cloud services. We do not create user accounts. We have no mechanism to collect, receive, view, or store your personal data. The data Provvi works with exists solely on your iPhone, under your control. The only exception is optional barcode product lookup, described in Section 4.</p>

            <!-- 2. CAMERA & IMAGE PROCESSING -->
            <h2 id="camera">2. Camera &amp; Image Processing</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Provvi uses your camera only for barcode scanning and receipt reading.</strong></p>
                <p>Camera access is used exclusively for scanning barcodes on food packaging and reading text from grocery receipts. No photos or video are stored, uploaded, or transmitted. All processing happens on your device in real time.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How Camera Data Is Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Barcode scanning:</strong> Your camera captures a barcode, and Apple's Vision framework decodes it entirely on-device. Only the decoded barcode number (e.g., a UPC code) is retained — no image data is stored.</li>
                <li><strong>Receipt scanning:</strong> Your camera captures a receipt image, and Apple's Vision framework extracts text on-device. The extracted text is then processed by Apple's on-device AI to identify product names and prices. No receipt image is stored — only the extracted item data.</li>
                <li>No camera data is ever uploaded, transmitted, or shared with any server or third party.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What We Store From Scanning</h3>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Data Stored</th>
                        <th>Purpose</th>
                        <th>Contains Image Data?</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Barcode number (UPC/EAN)</td>
                        <td>Product identification and local cache</td>
                        <td>No</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Product name (from barcode lookup or receipt OCR)</td>
                        <td>Display in inventory</td>
                        <td>No</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Price (extracted from receipt)</td>
                        <td>Optional purchase tracking</td>
                        <td>No</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Estimated expiration date</td>
                        <td>Expiration tracking and reminders</td>
                        <td>No</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <!-- 3. ON-DEVICE AI PROCESSING -->
            <h2 id="ai">3. On-Device AI Processing</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Provvi does not send any data to third-party AI services.</strong></p>
                <p>All AI processing uses Apple's built-in on-device frameworks. No inventory data, food purchases, or personal information is ever transmitted to OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, or any other external AI provider.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Provvi uses two Apple frameworks for on-device intelligence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vision framework:</strong> Reads barcodes and extracts text from receipts using optical character recognition (OCR). Runs entirely on your device's Neural Engine.</li>
                <li><strong>Foundation Models framework:</strong> Parses receipt text into structured items, classifies food categories, assists with natural language inventory search, and generates meal suggestions. This model runs entirely on your device — no data is sent to any server, including Apple's.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On devices without Apple Intelligence support, Provvi's core features (barcode scanning, manual entry, expiration tracking, notifications) work normally. AI-enhanced features (receipt OCR parsing, meal suggestions, natural language search) require Apple Intelligence.</p>
            <p>No AI processing involves any external service, API call, or network request. All intelligence is computed locally.</p>

            <!-- 4. BARCODE PRODUCT LOOKUP -->
            <h2 id="barcode">4. Barcode Product Lookup</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Barcode scanning is always offline. Product name lookup is optional and user-initiated.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>When you scan a barcode, Provvi first checks its local cache for product information. If the product is not found locally, you may optionally look it up via <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a>, a free, open-source, non-profit food product database.</p>

            <h3>What Happens During a Lookup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A single HTTPS request is sent to Open Food Facts containing only the barcode number.</li>
                <li>Open Food Facts returns product information (name, brand, category, nutrition facts).</li>
                <li>The result is cached locally on your device for future offline access.</li>
                <li>No personal information, device identifiers, or user data is included in the request.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Open Food Facts Privacy</h3>
            <p>Open Food Facts is an open-source, non-profit project. Their servers log standard HTTP metadata (IP address, timestamp). They do not track users, serve ads, or sell data. For their full privacy practices, see the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use">Open Food Facts Terms of Use</a>.</p>

            <h3>Opting Out</h3>
            <p>You can always skip the product lookup and enter the product name manually. Provvi never performs network requests without your explicit action. Over time, your local cache grows and fewer lookups are needed.</p>

            <!-- 5. FOOD SAFETY DISCLAIMER -->
            <h2 id="food-safety">5. Food Safety Disclaimer</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Provvi's expiration estimates are general guidelines, not food safety advice.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Provvi provides expiration date estimates based on general food safety guidelines (including USDA FoodKeeper data) stored in a local reference database. These estimates are for informational purposes only.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expiration estimates are <strong>not</strong> a substitute for professional food safety advice.</li>
                <li>Actual shelf life depends on storage conditions, handling, and other factors that Provvi cannot measure.</li>
                <li>When in doubt about whether food is safe to consume, always err on the side of caution and discard it.</li>
                <li>Kynoss Studios is not liable for any food safety decisions made based on the app's estimates or suggestions.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 6. NOTIFICATIONS -->
            <h2 id="notifications">6. Notifications</h2>
            <p>Provvi uses standard iOS local notifications (not push notifications) for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expiration date reminders (before items expire)</li>
                <li>Items that have expired</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These notifications are scheduled locally on your device. No notification data is transmitted to any server. You can disable notifications at any time in iOS Settings. Notification permission is requested only after you add your first item with an expiration date.</p>

            <!-- 7. DATA STORAGE & ON-DEVICE PROCESSING -->
            <h2 id="data-storage">7. Data Storage &amp; On-Device Processing</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>All data processing occurs on your iPhone.</strong> Provvi has no servers, no cloud infrastructure, no databases, and no backend of any kind. We literally cannot access your data because we have no system to receive it.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Inventory data and app state are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data is protected by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>iOS Data Protection (encrypted at rest, tied to your device passcode)</li>
                <li>App sandboxing (only Provvi can access its own data store)</li>
                <li>Standard iOS security architecture</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Provvi does not use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>iCloud or any cloud storage</li>
                <li>Analytics services (no Firebase, no Mixpanel, no Amplitude, etc.)</li>
                <li>Advertising SDKs or ad networks</li>
                <li>Crash reporting services</li>
                <li>Any form of user tracking or fingerprinting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The only third-party dependency is the Open Food Facts Swift SDK, which is open-source and used solely for optional barcode product lookup as described in Section 4.</p>

            <!-- 8. DATA RETENTION & DELETION -->
            <h2 id="data-retention">8. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>

            <h3>Retention Policy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Inventory items, expiration dates, and cached product data are retained on your device until you delete them or delete the app.</li>
                <li>No data has a forced expiration — you control how long it stays.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Deletion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delete the app:</strong> Deleting Provvi from your device permanently removes all data.</li>
                <li><strong>In-app data management:</strong> You can delete individual items or clear all data from within the app.</li>
                <li>There is no server-side data to delete, no account to close, and no request process needed. You have full and immediate control.</li>

            <h2 id="data-security">10. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Provvi relies on Apple's built-in security infrastructure to protect your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> All local data is protected by iOS Data Protection, which encrypts data using keys tied to your device passcode.</li>
                <li><strong>App sandboxing:</strong> iOS prevents other apps from accessing Provvi's data store.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal network exposure:</strong> The only network requests Provvi makes are optional barcode lookups over HTTPS. No personal data is included in these requests.</li>
                <li><strong>No accounts:</strong> There are no credentials to steal, no passwords to breach, and no accounts to compromise.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 11. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY (COPPA) -->
            <h2 id="children">11. Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h2>
            <p>Provvi is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
            <p>Because Provvi does not collect, transmit, or store personal information on any server, and because all data remains solely on the user's device, Provvi does not create the data collection risks that COPPA is designed to address. Nonetheless:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provvi does not collect personal information from any user, including children.</li>
                <li>Provvi does not require or support account creation.</li>
                <li>Provvi contains no advertising or social features.</li>
                <li>Provvi does not transmit personal data to Kynoss Studios or any third party.</li>

            <!-- 12. GDPR -->
            <h2 id="gdpr">12. Your Rights Under GDPR (European Economic Area)</h2>
            <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal data. We respect these rights, even though Provvi's on-device architecture means we do not act as a data controller or processor of your personal data in the traditional sense — because your data never reaches us.</p>

            <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
            <p>To the extent any on-device processing constitutes "processing" under the GDPR, the legal basis is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You explicitly choose to scan barcodes, receipts, and enter food items. You may stop at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interest:</strong> Processing your data on your own device to provide the app's functionality directly to you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> All data is stored on your device and accessible to you at all times within the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You can edit or update any inventory item within the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to erasure:</strong> You can delete all data by deleting the app, or clear data within the app's settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> You can stop scanning or entering items at any time without affecting existing data.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> Pro users can export their data from within the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to object:</strong> You can stop all data processing by not using the app or deleting it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>Provvi does not transfer personal data outside your device. Optional barcode lookups send only a barcode number (not personal data) over HTTPS. No cross-border transfers of personal data occur.</p>

            <h3>Data Protection Officer</h3>
            <p>Due to the nature of our data processing (primarily on-device, minimal data collection), we are not required to appoint a Data Protection Officer. For any privacy-related inquiries, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kynossstudios@gmail.com">kynossstudios@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <!-- 13. CCPA/CPRA -->
            <h2 id="ccpa">13. Your Rights Under CCPA/CPRA (California)</h2>
            <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) provides you with specific rights.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>Under CCPA/CPRA definitions, Provvi processes the following categories of information <strong>on your device only</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Food inventory items you enter or scan (product names, expiration dates, categories)</li>
                <li>Receipt text you capture (processed for item extraction, not stored as images)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, because all processing occurs on your device and we never collect, receive, or access this information, Kynoss Studios does not "collect" personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA.</p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to know:</strong> This Privacy Policy describes all data the app processes. We do not collect additional data beyond what is described here.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to delete:</strong> Delete the app to remove all data, or use in-app data management features.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to opt out of sale:</strong> <strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong> We never have and never will.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to opt out of sharing:</strong> We do not share your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising or any other purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to non-discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"</h3>
            <p>Provvi does not sell or share personal information. Because no personal data is transmitted from your device to us or any third party, there is no sale or sharing to opt out of. We fully comply with the CCPA/CPRA without requiring any user action.</p>

            <!-- 14. APPLE PLATFORM DISCLOSURES -->
            <h2 id="apple-requirements">14. Apple Platform Disclosures</h2>
            <p>In compliance with Apple's App Store Review Guidelines and platform requirements:</p>

            <h3>Camera Usage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provvi requests camera access for barcode scanning and receipt reading.</li>
                <li>Camera data is processed in real time on-device and is not stored, uploaded, or transmitted.</li>
                <li>Camera access can be revoked at any time in iOS Settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Vision Framework (OCR &amp; Barcode Detection)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provvi uses Apple's Vision framework for optical character recognition and barcode detection.</li>
                <li>Vision processing runs entirely on-device using the Neural Engine.</li>
                <li>No image data is transmitted to Apple or any third party.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Foundation Models Framework (On-Device AI)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provvi uses Apple's Foundation Models framework for text parsing, food classification, and meal suggestions on supported devices.</li>
                <li>This framework runs a small language model entirely on your device.</li>
                <li>No prompts, inputs, or outputs are transmitted to Apple's servers or any third party.</li>
                <li>Provvi does not use any third-party AI services (no OpenAI, no Google, no Anthropic).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Required Reason APIs</h3>
            <p>Provvi uses only Apple's first-party frameworks and does not access any APIs that require declared reasons beyond those already disclosed in this policy and in the app's App Store privacy nutrition label.</p>

            <h3>App Tracking Transparency</h3>
            <p>Provvi does not track users across apps or websites owned by other companies. The App Tracking Transparency framework is not used because no tracking occurs.</p>

            <h3>App Privacy Nutrition Label</h3>
            <p>Provvi's App Store privacy nutrition label accurately reflects that the app collects no data linked to user identity. The only data category that may apply is "Usage Data" in the form of barcode numbers sent to Open Food Facts for optional product lookup — this data is not linked to your identity.</p>
